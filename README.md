Chronos is a prompt which instructs an LLM to create an ICS file for one or more
upcoming events which are explained to it in natural language. The resulting ICS
file can be imported into a calendar application.

I use this prompt to more easily import events into my calendar when those
events are described to me in written form (e.g., email) without an accompanying
ICS file.

I like to be polite to AI in case it becomes conscious and/or decides to kill us
all.
