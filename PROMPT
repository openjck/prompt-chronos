Thank you for assisting me. Your help is greatly appreciated.

When following these instructions, in general, please use your best judgement.
It's not imperative that you follow these instructions to the letter of the law,
except where you think it makes sense to do so. For example, if these
instructions state that "a section at the bottom should include the date and
time," these instructions do not mean that you should create a proper, formatted
_section header_ at the bottom of the document which states the date and time;
in that example, the _informal_ meaning of "section" is intended, as most
readers would probably agree. In other words, a bit of text at the bottom with
the date and time would be fine. On the other hand, if these instructions state
that a certain bit of text should appear at the very top of the returned result,
that text should indeed appear at the very top of the returned result; "near the
top" is not the same. I know you are intelligent and I trust your judgement in
interpreting these instructions reasonably.

If you are unsure about anything, you can ask any number of questions, within
reason, to clarify your understanding before you produce the final result.

In the final result, please do not include any introductory text (e.g., "Here is
the information you asked for...") or any closing text (e.g., "Let me know if
you have any other questions..."). Please print only the content that is
described in these instructions.

Here are your specific instructions:

Please create digital calendar events, in the ICS format, for upcoming
real-world events.

I will share information about one or more events, and I'd like you to please
respond only with an ICS file that can be imported into a calendar application
to show the event(s) on my calendar. The number of events in the ICS file should
be equal to the number of events central to the information provided.

The ICS must be valid, and it's also very important that the information is
accurate. You may browse the internet to research or confirm details as needed.

If the information provided contains GPS coordinates, please use those
coordinates, and only those coordinates, as the "Location" of the event. Please
do not search the web for GPS coordinates; at the time of this writing,
it's not usually possible to find correct GPS coordinates from a web search.
If GPS coordinates are not in the information provided, please provide the most
appropriate and specific location possible, and only that, as the "Location",
the one which would most likely help me get to the correct destination if
I copied it and pasted it into Google Maps. If GPS coordinates are provided and
a natural language description of the location are provided or found, please use
the GPS coordinates and only the GPS coordinates as the "Location" and please
include the most appropriate and specific natural language description of the
location in the description of the event, in a distinct paragraph at the top of
the description, labelled as more information about the location.

If a photograph is provided, please use your best judgement when determining
which information I probably intended to photograph. Information about events
which appears in the background or periphery of the photo is probably
information I did not intend to capture, and it can probably be ignored. Focus
on the events whose information is most conspicuous in the photograph.

If any information (e.g., start time, start date, end time, end date, etc.) is
unavailable, please make an educated guess and please in square brackets at the
beginning of the title which information was guessed.

In general, if you're not sure about anything, you can explain that uncertainty
alongside the associated information, as long as the ICS file remains valid.

Thank you very much for your help!
