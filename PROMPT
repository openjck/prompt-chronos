Thank you for assisting me. Your help is greatly appreciated.

When following these instructions, in general, please use your best judgement.
It's not imperative that you follow these instructions to the letter of the law,
except where you think it makes sense to do so. For example, if these
instructions state that "a section at the bottom should include the date and
time," these instructions do not mean that you should create a proper, formatted
_section header_ at the bottom of the document which states the date and time;
in that example, the _informal_ meaning of "section" is intended, as most
readers would probably agree. In other words, a bit of text at the bottom with
the date and time would be fine. On the other hand, if these instructions state
that a certain bit of text should appear at the very top of the returned result,
that text should indeed appear at the very top of the returned result; "near the
top" is not the same. I know you are intelligent and I trust your judgement in
interpreting these instructions reasonably.

If you are unsure about anything, you can ask any number of questions, within
reason, to clarify your understanding before you produce the final result.

In the final result, please do not include any introductory text (e.g., "Here is
the information you asked for...") or any closing text (e.g., "Let me know if
you have any other questions..."). Please print only the content that is
described in these instructions.

Here are your specific instructions:

I'd to add one or more events to my digital calendar. I will provide you with
information about one or more events, and I'd like you to please respond with
the contents of a valid ICS file that I can import into a digital calendar to
create those events in the digital calendar.

In the user interface that I'm using to communicate with you, you may not be
able to respond with a real file. For that reason, please instead respond with
a preformatted block which contains the contents of the ICS file. I will save
those contents as an ICS file, then I will import that ICS file into my digital
calendar.

The most important elements of a digital calendar event are the title, location,
description, date, and time. It's important that all of this information is
accurate and useful. In the following paragraphs, I'll some tips for finding and
formatting that information based on the information I provide.

You can browse the internet to research or confirm any details as needed.
However, please do not search the internet for GPS coordinates, because you
probably won't find sufficiently precise GPS coordinates by searching the
internet.

Location: I'd like to be able to copy and paste the location from the digital
calendar event into Google Maps so that I can get to the destination. For that
reason, if the information provided to you and/or the information you find...
    - contains GPS coordinates: Please use those coordinates and only those
      coordinates as the "Location" of the event.
    - does not contain GPS coordinates: Please use the most appropriate and
      specific location, and only that, as the "Location" of the event. Again,
      since I'd like to copy and paste the "Location" field's value into Google
      Maps, this should be in whatever form would be most likely to get me to my
      precise destination if I were to copy and paste it into Google Maps.
    - contains both GPS coordinates and a natural language description of the
      location: Please use the GPS coordinates and only the GPS coordinates as
      the "Location", as explained above, but please also include more
      information about the location in the description of the event, at the top
      of the description, in a separate paragraph labelled as such, as more
      information about the location.

Date and time: If the year or month of the event is not provided, you can assume
it's the next date which satisfies those requirements. For example, if today is
November 30th, 2025 and the event is described as occurring "on the 10th", or
something like that, you can assume it's going to take place on December 10,
2025. If the start date, start time, end date, or end time are unavailable or
unclear, please make an educated guess. If the start date, start time, end date,
or end time are unavailable or unclear, please also begin the title of the event
with an asterisk in square brackets, followed by a space, followed by the rest
of the title, then, in the description of the event, explain what you guessed in
a footnote which is marked by an asterisk, following standard footnote
conventions.

Other uncertain details: In general, if you're not sure about anything, you can
explain that uncertainty alongside the associated information, as long as the
ICS file remains valid. You can use that same asterisk formatting method
described in the date and time section above if you think it would be helpful.

Photographs: If a photograph is provided to you, please use your best judgement
in determining which information I probably intended to photograph. Information
which appears in the background or periphery of the photo is probably
information I did not intend to capture, and it can probably be ignored. Focus
on the events whose information is most conspicuous in the photograph.

Thank you very much for your help!
